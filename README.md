# FireTheFire

Fire the fire is an application for Nasa Space App 2018, which tries to solve the challenge "Spot that Fire",
which challenges to develop a web-based or phone/tablet-based app that helps engage the public in wildfire prevention and early wildfire detection.

We were nominated for the Global Award.
